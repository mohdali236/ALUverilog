Group Type : Cohort of 5

Cohort Name : Skumg

How Cohort Will Function : Discord and in-person communication.

Build Plan : Our group is creating a 64 bit Arithmetic Logic Unit that will allow up to 32 bit
inputs. The ALU will handle basic mathematical functions such as adding, subtracting,
multiplying, dividing, and modulus of two numbers, in addition to the logic operations of
bitwise AND, OR, XOR, and so on. The ALU will function as the core mathematical
functionality of our examples in which we solve basic mathematics and physics problems.
